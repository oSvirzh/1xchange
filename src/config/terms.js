      Trading cryptocurrencies is a high risk activity which may result in you
      incurring significant losses or losing your entire investment. You should
      carefully consider whether investing in or trading cryptocurrencies is
      suitable for you in light of your financial status and, should you decide
      that it is, never invest in or trade with more than you are willing to
      lose. It is your sole responsibility to educate yourself on the risks
      involved in trading cryptocurrency. No communication or information
      provided by us shall be construed as advice of any kind, whether
      financial, investment, tax, legal or any other kind of expert advice. We
      do not hold any cryptocurrency as your trustee, and do not act as your

      the risks involved, you should seek expert advice prior to commencing
      trading. By using any of&#160; the services we provide you confirm that
